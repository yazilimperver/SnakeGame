# Snake Game
This repository contains our next game example which is snake. It is a console based game to illustrate the overall logic and see how can we employ the console for such game. It is based on game loop repository (obviously) but I seperated this and will manage so. However, you can find every line of code about console that I gave in game loop example (and more of course).

Currently game supports single player (multi player is coming also :), have a nice main menu and improved game screen. 
So enjoy it and do not hesitate to contribute. I will update this repository time to time and inform you about important milestones.
